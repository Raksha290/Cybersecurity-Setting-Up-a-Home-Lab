# Cybersecurity-Setting-Up-a-Home-Lab
# Description
This project outlines the creation of a home lab for practicing cybersecurity skills using VirtualBox. It features two virtual machines: Ubuntu for defensive security and Kali Linux for offensive testing. The VMs are connected through a NAT network, enabling secure experimentation with network attacks and defenses.

# Features
Ubuntu VM: Configured with UFW for firewall management and Wireshark for traffic analysis.
Kali Linux VM: Equipped with nmap for network scanning and vulnerability assessment.
NAT Network: Allows isolated communication between VMs, enhancing security.

# Prerequisites
Basic networking knowledge.
A computer with at least 8GB of RAM.
VirtualBox installed.
ISO images for Ubuntu and Kali Linux.

# Setup Instructions
Install VirtualBox.
Create VMs for Ubuntu and Kali Linux.
Configure NAT Network in VirtualBox.
Install and configure necessary tools on both VMs.
Run network scans and implement defensive measures to simulate real-world scenarios.

# Conclusion
This home lab provides hands-on experience with cybersecurity principles, allowing users to learn and practice skills in a controlled environment.
